This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with examples and exercises to learn data manipulation with Python, using the libraries NumPy and Pandas.

The notebooks cover a range of topics, from basic operations on arrays and data types to more advanced techniques such as pivot tables and merging data.

## Table of Contents

The repository contains the following notebooks:

-   `01_array.ipynb`: Introduction to arrays in NumPy
-   `02_data_types.ipynb`: Overview of data types in Python and NumPy
-   `03_dimensions.ipynb`: Working with dimensions in NumPy arrays

-   `18_join.ipynb`: Joining data with Pandas
-   `19_pivot_table.ipynb`: Creating pivot tables with Pandas
-   `20_apply.ipynb`: Using `.apply()` in Pandas

Additionally, there is an `Init notebook.ipynb` file which introduces the libraries NumPy and Pandas and provides some basic examples.

The data used in the notebooks is stored in the `bestsellers.csv` file.

## Requirements

To run the notebooks in this repository, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system, as well as the following libraries:

-   NumPy
-   Pandas
-   Jupyter Notebook

You can install these libraries using the following command in your terminal:

`pip install numpy pandas jupyter` 

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you can clone it to your local machine using Git:

bash

`git clone https://github.com/[username]/Data-Manipulation-with-Python.git` 

Replace `[username]` with your GitHub username.

Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file by clicking on the "Code" button at the top of the repository page and selecting "Download ZIP".

Once you have the repository on your local machine, navigate to the repository directory in your terminal and start Jupyter Notebook:

`jupyter notebook` 

This will open a web browser window showing the Jupyter Notebook interface. From there, you can navigate to the notebook you want to open and run the code cells to see the examples and complete the exercises.
