# Basic Python

This folder contains some Python files that I have written based on the [Basic Python course](https://platzi.com/cursos/python/) by Platzi, and the [Scientific Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) by FreecodeCamp. The *.Py* files contain some examples of Python data types, operators, functions, loops, etc.
