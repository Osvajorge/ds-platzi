# Professional Python

This repository is a collection of Python code and examples based on the professional Python Course [Intermediate Python course](https://platzi.com/cursos/python/) by Platzi and the [Scientific Python course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) by FreecodeCamp. The repository includes the following topics:

-   Lists and dictionaries
-   List comprehensions
-   Dictionary comprehensions
-   Lambda functions
-   High-order functions
-   Data filtering
-   Debugging
-   Palindrome detection
-   Assert statement
-   File handling

The repository includes the following files:

-   [**isprime.py**](https://github.com/Osvajorge/Data-Science-Platzi-Courses/tree/main/professional_python/isprime.py): This file contains a function that checks if a number is prime.
-  [**iterators.py**](https://github.com/Osvajorge/Data-Science-Platzi-Courses/tree/main/professional_python/iterators.py): This file contains examples of iterators in Python.
-   [**mygen.py**](https://github.com/Osvajorge/Data-Science-Platzi-Courses/tree/main/professional_python/mygen.py): This file contains a custom generator function.
-   [**palindrome.py**](https://github.com/Osvajorge/Data-Science-Platzi-Courses/tree/main/professional_python/): This file contains a function that checks if a word is a palindrome.
-   [**set_operators.py**](https://github.com/Osvajorge/Data-Science-Platzi-Courses/tree/main/professional_python/palindrome.py): This file contains examples of set operations in Python.
-   [**sets.py**](https://github.com/Osvajorge/Data-Science-Platzi-Courses/tree/main/professional_python/sets.py): This file contains examples of sets in Python.
 
All code in this repository is intended to serve as a reference and a starting point for your own projects. The Professional Python course is designed to help you master these advanced concepts in Python and apply them in your own work.

## In addition: 
These two programs [palindrome.py](https://github.com/Osvajorge/Data-Science-Platzi-Courses/blob/main/professional_python/palindrome.py) and [isprime.py](https://github.com/Osvajorge/Data-Science-Platzi-Courses/blob/main/professional_python/isprime.py) were created with static typing and with errors in order to check through **mypy** how those errors actually occur.

This is the original error in [palindrome.py](https://github.com/Osvajorge/Data-Science-Platzi-Courses/blob/main/professional_python/palindrome.py)

If we run this program with `mypy palindrome.py --check-untyped-defs` instead of `py palindrome.py`

The same occurs with the isprime.py error.
