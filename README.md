# Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Courses by Platzi

This repository is dedicated to the learning journey through [Data Science and Artificial intelligence path](https://platzi.com/datos/) offered by [Platzi](https://platzi.com/home). It contains exercises, projects, and code snippets that have been completed as part of the curriculum. The primary focus of the repository is to showcase the skills and knowledge gained in the areas of:

-   Python programming, including its data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotLib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, etc.
-   Data visualization using tools such as Tableau and Power BI
-   Mathematics and algebra for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the platzi path (I worked on until now):

-   [Basic Python](https://github.com/Osvajorge/Data-Science-Platzi-Courses/tree/main/basic-python)
-   [Intermediate Python](https://github.com/Osvajorge/Data-Science-Platzi-Courses/tree/main/intemediate-python)
-   [Professional Python](https://github.com/Osvajorge/Data-Science-Platzi-Courses/tree/main/professional_python)

The content within each folder will be updated regularly as new projects and exercises are completed.

## Contributing

This repository is open for contributions and suggestions for improvements. If you would like to contribute, please create a pull request with a detailed explanation of your changes.

## Future Goals

In the future, I plan to expand the repository to include projects that use advanced techniques in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, as well as adding more data visualization projects. The ultimate goal of this repository is to serve as a comprehensive portfolio of my data science skills and learning journey.

## Conclusion

This repository serves as a hub for my ongoing learning and growth in the field of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. It is my hope that others can also benefit from the resources and projects contained within.
